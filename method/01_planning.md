# Planning your site

Key to successfully building any product, wireframing any prototype or learning anything is actually sitting down and thinking about what you build.

It sounds stupidly obvious, but it is something a lot of people don't do. Even professional web developers can rather aimlessly build things at times.

Before you write any code you must sketch out paper what it is you need to build, what will be required and draw out the elements and content blocks needed to achieve what you are building.

> This doesn't mean that your plans can't change or evolve. Just, no architect or contractor would proceed building something without prviously considering what they were building, the budget for the building, the require materials etc.

This can be quite difficult at times. If it was easy, web development wouldn't be well paid and so rewarding an activity.

## So, we are building?

In this chapter I'll do the heavy lifting and just give a high-level overview of what we'll build in this chapter. But, as this book progresses we'll expand out the planning period and give you real clues into how to develop sites like a professional with Middleman.

In this chapter we'll create a common vanity project, the portfolio site.

Rather than a "Look at my fancy CSS that works on one browser if you stand upside down while gurgling" porftolio, it'll be a vanity porfolio for an Evil Tyrannical Monster from a inner-circle of Hell 

> If you think this is a silly project, just wait until you have a paying client...

For this site, we'll create:

Home page > "Create a shop window into my work, an eye-catching summary"
About page > "A place to talk about where I came from and what I've achieved and my love for cats"
Portfolio page > "Place to document, with my clients, the great work achieved so that prospective clients "
Contact Page > "Way to convert interested website vistiors into hot leads"
Blog stream > "Place to release news and updates"

In terms of the look and feel of the site we'll use a lot of browns, because Monster's love brown?

In terms of the actual pages we'll need:

Home page
About page
Portfolio summary, and individual pages for the case studies
contact page
blog summary page, individual blog post pages
